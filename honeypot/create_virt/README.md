This directory contains 2 subdirectories: centos/ and ubuntu/ 
These two directories contain the necessary scripts and initialization 
files to create centos and ubuntu VMs respectively. The scripts 
completely automate the process so that there are no click through steps. 
After completing the VM creation and OS 
installation (what these scripts do), you will have to run the 
setup scripts that are contained in '../setup\_virt' to install the 
necessary monitoring and infrastructure packages for the honeypots.
